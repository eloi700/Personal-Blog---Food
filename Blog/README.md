## Personal Blog Website (FoSA) - Project 1
-----
* FoSA (Food in Southeast Asia) is a blog that talks about different cuisine of the countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore,  Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Cambodia.
  
* Building this Personal Blog Website is quite challenging specially when I need to start from scratch.   This however, improved further my skills in HTML and CSS /SCSS.  I applied what I have learned online previously as well as from  Udacity. I thank you Udacity for this memorable project.
